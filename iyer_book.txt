PREFACE  
Authors are of two types - those that edit for edition sake and a few for the spread of knowledge. My intention is 
one of latter class. I am not new to the astrological en thusiasts  – at least to the readers of Prof. B.V. Raman's 
Astrological magazine , in which my series of articles under the caption " New Techniques of Prediction " have 
appeared since February 1962 issue.  I could have straight -away published this book, withou t such previous 
revelations. But my sincere wish was that its merit must be first known to the public before the publication of 
this book , as I feared that this book may be thought to be one among many already in the market. I had no 
intention to publish s o early as this, as all my research work  is not yet over and there are still many more 
wonderful subjects under examination. But the urge of many of the readers of my articles has been so heavy that 
I could not postpone to a later date. As far as possible majority of the principles that have proved true by 
research are included in this edition , reserving the rest for future. That what all I have expounded is genuine and 
marvelous  may be seen from the several opinions of the readers who also had consulted me . 
During the past 35 years I have made a deep study of astrology  and allied subjects. My experience is that more 
you study from the books that are in the open market the more you get confused than grow wiser. For several 
authors and commentators have state d various theories and commentaries, s ometimes contrary too . Moreover , 
almost all rules are full of alternatives , confusing one's mind. Whenever there are alternative or  optional 
theories , the only way of perfecting it  is by research  and by applying them t o know n charts rather than gamble 
with the dictionary meaning of words. As research work had paid well in the case of other sciences, even here it 
will have the best of effects and it should be encouraged. In olden days there was royal patronage . Now that 
kingship is abolished, the Government or some public organization  should aid. For, no one individual can do 
the ocean wide research work for obvious reasons. For instance, to establish the cause ( astrological ) for leprosy, 
charts at a leprosarium  should be  collected,  for consumption at sanatorium , for mental derangement at mental 
hospitals etc. To do this, public help and patronage of the Government are needed. Bearing this in mind , after a 
stage of study I took to research work and after a long time when m y planets also were favourably disposed for 
genuine research,  some new flashes struck me and some advantageous situations arose of their own accord. 
When I say this I do this with authority. Even a well -read and proficient astrologer, if not backed by favorable  
planets, is likely to go down at such unpropitious times. This being Vedanga , all cannot hope to be all successful 
at all times. One must be godly and before venture he must think of his deity and then proceed. For, it is only 
then he will have prope r flashes especially in matters of alternative situations.  
Next I wish to trace the origin of this science , its gradual development and its present state. All know that it is 
Vedanga. As Veda is spelled by God so is this science too. There are versions sta ting that Iswara narrated this 
science  to Parvathi and Nandikeswara to his disciples. Then came the days of Maharishis who by  their superior 
knowledge and clairvoyance taught their disciples orally. You may be aware of one Saptha -Rishi Vakyam , 
meaning that  seven Maharishis had discussed this science. Next came the days when some of their disciples 
took to scribing mostly on palm leaves. So far this sacred science  was being held safe in their hands. Next 
followed the days of Daivagnas who , though not equal t o the class of Rishi  Shisyas , were of sufficiently superior 
intellect and more than all godly. Thus with their intellect and intuition  they wrote out texts. Unfortunately it 
was poetic era, prose being of recent origin. In the anxiety  to maintain rhyme and  grammar , they had to use 
sometimes words with double meaning or even distracted meaning. The author is sure of the  proper meaning of 
his writing,  but when others read his verses very likely doubts arise. Actually it has been so and this has given 
rise to many commentators viewing the same matter differen tly. Varahamihira in his Brihat Jataka has in the 
very opening verse said that due to hurried writing and short space he had to compose verses with words of 
deep and multiple meanings. Anyone perusing Briha t Jataka may feel that there is nothing substantial helping 
prediction. One may even go to the extent of saying that his sayings may not be always true. I too held such a 
view so far. Yet this is the first text quoted by all. Really it must be a great and valuable work. It is only when my 
research proved good I began to appreciate the monumental work. Very many secrets are there hidden. For 
example, a long Chapter  deals with various kinds of Ayurdayas. It is not meant only to estimate the longevity. 
From th e several rays attributed to planets the magnitude of effects may be gauged. I have illustrated them in 
Chapter VII on finding quantum of wealth and  number of issues. Likewise I have seen astrologers  gauging other 
matters , but they have held them with them selves and for themselves. If they come out with those secrets they 
would be not only rendering their meritorious service to this science but would be helping the public as well.  
Now about this publication. I had intended to publish only the results of my research  work , leaving off the 
elementary portions to the readers themselves. But many of my friends requested me to bring forth a self -
sufficient and exhaustive treatise. So, I have attempted at it and placed before the public in two parts. This 
treatise contains very many new points not known to many so far. I have tried my best to render the  science  
mathematical. I have selected only those theories that have stood the test in all cases leaving off unproved ones. 
As my object is to spread these novel idea s, I feel satisfied if the readers follow my theories faithfully and adopt 
them in their future handling.

PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION   by Chistabo, A.D. 2012

 « 
 page  ~ II ~ New Techniques of Prediction – Book I  This treatise has two parts. The first part contains all the preliminaries and the general cannons that have to be 
learnt by all. Let me review Part 1 for the present. The first Chapter  deals with definitions and nomenclatures . 
English, Sanskrit and Tamil names are given with the abbreviation for planets and Rasis that may be used in this 
treatise. In this Chapter  the derivations of the month, weekday  are explained. The fitting in of year, month, Yoga  
star etc. into the Zodiac is shown.  
This is a novelty. The  use of five Angas viz. Thithi  etc. is revealed  - a hidden secret. Graha Samayam is a very 
useful subject which is shown in detail. Finally the  meth od of rectification of birth Dasha is explained - a puzzle 
so far.  
Chapter II deals with the Karakatwa of Rasi, Bhava, Nakshatra  and Graha . Here the subject is handled with care. 
All things said here are truths found after application. Very many modern ide as are said here.  
Chapter III deals with the preliminaries to be observed to cast a horoscope. The Ayanamsha and ephemeris to be 
followed are suggested. The Tatwa theory helpful to verify the birth time is explained. Working of a chart from 
the ephemeris and Panchanga are illustrated. Even a layman may learn the subject well.  
Chapter IV describes Shadbala in a concise form.  
Chapter V deals with Yogas, a brief but exhaustive method of description is used here.  
Chapter VI deals with female horoscopy . The hand ling of this is unique.  
Chapter VII, the last Chapter  of Bhava Phalam is a special treatment not found in any book in such a methodical 
way.  
Lastly my thanks to Prof. B.V. Raman who has been kind enough to ventilate my articles in his esteemed 
magazine and to many of my friends who have lent their moral support to the editing of this treatise .

PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION  
This edition is both a revised and enlarged one, in that some of the doubtful  subjects treated in first and second 
editions are moderated and made more clear. In the Chapter on Bhava Phala thorough revision is effected and 
some of the topics as Neecha Bhanga Yoga etc. left out in the previous editions now included with all noveltie s. 
This edition contains mode of judgment  of Bhava Phalams with illustrations . 
As this edition is the outcome of latest research  work, the readers will be at better advantageous position. That 
this is a monumental orig inal work unprecedented in the history  of this sacred science may be seen from the 
opinions volunteered by our clients.

OPINION  
The  Hindu  
"Few books on the subject of predictions published in recent years have been so exhaustive  or self -contained. 
The author… has done considerable research. Very  many new rules are enunciated … Many matters of  
every day consultation are explained on the basis o f new and unequivocal principle ... Practicing  astrologers  will 
benefit greatly fr om a study of these volumes of NTP."

 NOTE  
I being a serious student of astrology since more than four decades, was not satisfied with the general 
theoretical books on  astrology  flooded in the market. Though I have great esteem for all classical works, which I 
methodically assimilated with the help of great scholars with whom I was associated for several years, still my 
mind was always in search of more secrets & the mi ssing links of this great science. Fortunately, I had the 
blessings of God Almighty to have many secrets from great Pandits  of this country whose names I always think 
and remember in my morning prayers. Of these great Pandits , Mr . H.R. Seshadri Iyer, the a uthor of " NEW 
TECHNIQUES OF PREDICTION " (Parts I, II, III ) has highly influenced my mind in understanding this age -old science 
with many missing links, with proper perspective. After going through this system & techniques which I applied 
for more than two decades, I can confidently say that no student of astrology should miss his works & study 
them carefully to understand his techniques which will be very useful in our day -to-day astrological analysis. I 
have taught these techniques to all my students in In dia and abroad & all my students are very happy as they 
found it very useful.

 « 
 page  ~ III ~ New Techniques of Prediction – Book I  I was overjoyed when I heard that Mr. B.K. Mahipal of Janapriya Prakashana, Bangalore , undertook the task of 
publishing these books which are out of print today. I was also pleas ed to make here & there some notes to 
make t he students understand  properly ; my intention was not to change anything in the books the author has 
written. I hope that the student community and the general public who are interested in astrology will make use  
of these hooks which are very useful not only for beginners, but also for students who wish to make higher 
studies in astrology.

 Varsha (years )

Reckoning of year is of several modes. West counts it from fir st of January. Barhaspathya Mana  is counted from 
the day Guru  enters a sign, lunar year is counted from Chaitra Shukla Padyami and solar year is reckoned from 
the time Surya  enters Mesha . For purposes of astrology  solar  year and solar  months only have to be  considered. 
There are 60 years forming a cycle. They are said to be named after the 60 sons of Narada. Here I wish to point 
out a special feature. No useful purpose would be served by simply narrating an element if it could not be made 
use of for predicti ons. There are books speak ing on the effects of years, months, Thithi  etc. But not a single 
effect fits into individual horoscopes. I always value things and elements said with respect to zodiac  (birth

 page  ~ 2 ~ New Techniques of Prediction – Book I  chart ). Unless they have a specific place in the birth chart  no useful purpose will be served by mere ly honoring  
them for namesake.  
It is an established fact that Kaliyu ga started in the year Pramadi at the first point of Mesha. Starting with Mesha 
each sign has five years starting from Pramadi. Thus all 60 years get distributed equally and in successive  order 
among the 12 signs of the zodiac . 
Further, every year is spread around 6° of the Rasi in order. For example , Pramadi is located from 0° to 6° of 
Mesha, Vikrama from 7 to 12, Vishu from 13 to 18, Chitrab hanu from 19 to 24,  Swabhanu from 25 to 30 of Mesh a. 
Then Tharana starts f rom Vrishabha and spreads from 0 to 6 degrees and so on till finally the year Bahudhanya 
falling between 25 to 30 degrees of Meena. Many are not aware of locating the years into the zodiac . By further 
manipulations converting the sign positions of t hese years into different Varga Kundalis ( division charts ), one 
can read even without Dasha  Bhukti the year, month and day of the happening of an event of the birth details of 
the partner o r any relative. I am at research on this point and hope to come out with success shortly. As per this 
theory every Rasi has 60 years, 12 months and 30 Thithis . A planet situated at a position gives out its effects 
during the year etc., appropriate to that point in the zodiac . For ready reference I give below the 60 years with 
their equivalent English era.
