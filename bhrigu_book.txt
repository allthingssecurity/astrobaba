Preface
jr\the term samhita connotes 'compilation', itcannot beexpected
tobeanoriginal work. Itsbusiness istocondense many Shastras.
It,therefore, includes details ofmany subjects found invaried works.
Thesamhita inastrological parlance isnothing butanencyclopaedia
ofastrological andother aspects ofhuman interest. Itisalsomundane
astrology withmany scientific topics and other subjects inwhich
human beings have anabiding faith, Hence, thesamhita can rightly
betermed awork ofsocial science, forsocial science hasreference to
andexplanation ofalmost alltheaspects ofsocial lifeandthose that
have ahuman appeal.
Varamihira expresses hisindebtedness toancient sages like Kapila,
Garga, Kasyapa, Atri, Bhrigu etc; foraccording tohim, acountry
thatdoes notpossess agood astrologer isdamned. Agood astrologer
must beanall-rounder. Though there isnodearth ofbooks available
onpredictive astrology inthisworld, which aregrand intheirown
way, most ofthem areneither easy tothe satisfaction ofgeneral
public norcomprehensive enough tosatisfy theexperts. Sokeeping
this inview, Bhrigu Samhita hasbeen invoked. Theprimary view of
thisbook isthatbecause themystery ofwhole human life ishidden
inthenine planets ofahoroscope, itwillnotbepossible todiscover
theevents ofthewhole lifeofthenative tillthe effects ofevery
planet isnot clearly known without which thecomplicated science
ofastrology cannot besimplified. Itiswith this foundation that
every ascendant isdescribed inthebook.
Thebook gives very valuable hints onhow tofind outthecharacter
ofanative, hismoral inclination, and hisfortunes andmisfortunes
invarious walks oflife. Italso provides useful information with
regard tolongevity andprosperity ofthenative, hisparents, brothers

andchildren. This willenable anyamateur orprofessional astrologer
topredict with accuracy the future ofthenative and toform an
opinion astohow aplanet isdisposed inaparticular nativity.
Inthecourse ofwriting thisbook, several publications were referred
toand Ihave endeavoured topresent inthisbook the essential
principles culled outfrom various standard andpublished works.
The author ishighly grateful toPustak Mahal, New Delhi, who
showed their keen interest inpublishing thisbook.

Introduction
Sage Bhrigu—The Father ofHindu Astrology
Astrology isaVedanga, that is,oneofthelimbs oftheVedas. Vedas
were studied bytheancient sages and rishis, outofwhom Saptarishis
were themost famous. Bhrigu wasone oftheSaptarishis. He is
Manasaputra (wish-born-son) ofLord Brahma, who simply wished
him into existence, toassist theprocesses ofcreation. Hewasmarried
toKhyati, thedaughter ofDaksha. Hehadtwo sons from her—
Dhata andVidhata. Goddess Laxmi* theconsort ofVishnu, is
considered tobehisdaughter. Hehadonemore son, Shukra, who
was better known than Bhrigu himself. The sageChyavana was also
believed tobehisson.
TheBhrigus, alsoknown asBhargavas, were aclanofsages descending
from theancient fire-priest Bhrigu. They instituted the ritual of
offering thejuice oftheSoma plant totheoldduties. Some ofthem
were also warriors inaddition tobeing priests. The Bhrigus are
intimately linked with thecomposition ofAtharva Veda.
Bhrigu Samhita
Bhrigu iscredited asthe father ofHindu astrology, and the first
astrological treatise Bhrigu Samhita isattributed tohisauthorship.
This treatise issaid tocontain over 5million horoscopes, inwhich
hewrote down the fateofevery being intheUniverse. According to
thepopular tradition, only about ahundredth ofthese horoscopes
have survived tothis age.
TheBhrigu Samhita isanastrological classic written byMaharshi
Bhrigu during theVedic period, although the available evidence


10 •Bhrigu Samhita
suggests that itwascompiled over aperiod oftime bythevarious
students ofBhrigu. Itisaconfirmed fact that Saint Bhrigu was the
firstcompiler ofpredictive astrology, which came tobeknown as
the FifthVeda ofTreta Yug, which isanancient agemarking the
beginning oftheHindu Culture, Hecompiled about 5lakhs
horoscopes with thehelp ofLord Ganesha andrecorded details and
events ofthepersons along with their ages. This formed thedatabase
forfurther research and study. The study culminated inthebirth
ofthescience (Shastra) ofdetermining thequality oftime (Mora),
known astheBrihat Prasara Mora Shastra. These horoscopes were
based upon theplanetary positions oftheSun, theMoon, Mercury,
Venu s,Mars ,Jupiter ,Saturn ,Dragon 'sHead (Rahu) andDragon's
Tail (Ketu). After that, Maharshi Bhrigu gave hispredictions on
different types ofhoroscopes compiled byhim with thehelp of
Lord Ganesha inabriefand concise manner.
During the foreign invasions inIndia, Brahmin community was
dispersed allover India. The invaders also captured these prime
assets ofBrabmins. Forthem, itwas amiraculous form oftelling the
fortune ofaperson and sosome parts oftheBhrigu Samhita were
taken away bythem totheforeign countries, Themost unfortunate
and destructive happening was thedestruction ofNalanda University
library. Itisreally unfortunate thatsome people having acheap and
fraudulent form ofBhrigu Samhita claim tohave theoriginal Shastra
intheir possession.
Ifanoriginal Bhrigu Samhita? sleafcontaining thehoroscope ofan
individual isobtained, we will find that itnotonly reveals the
consulting day,time anddate oftheindividual, butalso theremedial
measures. Some thousands ofleaflet horoscopes from the original
Bhrigu Samhita arebelieved tobeavailable with onepundit in
Hoshiyarpur, inPunjab. Itisalso very unfortunate thatdozens of
pundits inIndia claim tohave the original Bhrigu Samhita
with them.


Introduction •11
Uniqueness ofBhrigu Samhita
Many ofthebooks available onpredictive astrology areneither easy
enough tobeunderstood bythegeneral public nor fully satisfactory
forthepundits. Therefore theprimary view kept inthisbook isthat
because themystery ofthewhole human life ishidden inthenine
planets ofahoroscope, itwill notbepossible todiscuss theevents
ofthewhole lifeofthenative tillthe effects ofevery planet isnot
clearly known. Without it,thecomplicated science ofastrology
cannot besimplified. Itiswith thisunderstanding inthebook that
every ascendant hasbeen treated with theplacement oftheplanets
ineach ofthe 12houses inazodiacal diagram.
1stHouse: (Ascendant) Physique, will-power, fame, figure andphysical
complex
Ilnd House: Finance, family, speech, treasure andbondage
Illrd House: Brothers and sisters, energy, physical work andcourage
IVth House: Mother, motherly relations, land andbuildings, peace
and happiness
VthHouse: Education, children, speech andknowledge

grandfather, defeats and victories

Important Observation
Sometimes theascendant iscalculated wrongly due tothemistake
ofanhour orsointhebirth time. But thesame canbecorrected
inthegiven manner, though themistake might have occurred due
towrong watches orwrong calculations bytheones casting the
horoscope ordue tothe carelessness ofparents toremember the
exact time ofbirth.
Take forexample, ifaperson's lagna isAquarius and theresults are
nottallying, youmust correct thelagna asCapricorn andstudy the
case. Also cast itasPisces andstudy theresults. Theone that gives
correct predictions should betaken ascorrect. Sobypermutations
andcombinations, you can getthe correct lagna.
Points tobeborne inmind while casting thelagna

Differences intheCharts ofMen andWomen
The predictions inthisbook areapplicable tothehoroscopes of
women inthesame sense asthey areapplicable tothehoroscopes
ofmen with theonly differences that (1)thepredictions about wife
inthemale horoscope applies tothepredictions about husband in
thefemale horoscopes, and (2)thepredictions about theoccupations
inthe female's horoscope will apply tothehusband.
The events oftheperiods oflifeshould bepredicted through
yVimsottari andyAntaradashas\
When inthehoroscope ofmen, theVims ottariDosha isbenefic, it
istheperiod ofoutright progress ofdestiny. When between husband
andwife, thedosha ofone isgood andthatoftheother isbad, it
istheperiod ofordinary rise. Similarly, when both have malefic
dashas theperiod isharmful. When there istheAntara ofthebest
planet inthedosha, itisthemost fortunate period.
How toRemove Doubts
Ifinthehoroscope ofanative, aplanet causes benefit about a
particular matter and theother planets cause maleficence about the
same matter, itshould beunderstood thatboth thepredictions
would take place inthe lifethough may beinany shape. The


14 •Bhrigu Samhita
timings andshape oftheevent canchange butthe effects cannot be
eliminated. The other point tobeborne inmind isthat itisthe
combined effect ofallthenine planets which forms the life, nature
and their features ofhuman beings. Everybody should consider the
decisions regarding hisdestiny through thecombined effect ofall
these nine planets.

Example
Just tobroach onthe subject, Mars isthesignificator of3rdhouse,
which stands foradventure, valour and foreign travel. Itisthesame
thing which Mars also signifies. Hence, Mars iscalled thesignificator
of3rdhouse.
Ifproper attention isnotpaid onthe signification planets inthe
matter ofpredictions, there arechances oftheprediction going
wrong. Forexample, theMoon isthe significator ofthe4thhouse
andhence ifitrelates to4thhouse, then irrespective ofthepossibility
ofthe4thlordbeing weak, thenative gains thehappiness ofhouse
and vehicle. Similarly Sun isconsidered asbenefic forthe 1st
,9th
and 10'houses because he isthe significator ofsoul, mind, body,
fortune, wealth, position, honour, power, fame, promotion and
fatherly happiness.
Moon has avery important role toplay andhas achangeable
character. Moon when inconjunction with Venus willbecome
deceptive innature.


Introduction • 11
Mercury isaplanet which causes depression when itisweak. Similarly
Mars, when debilitated andaspected bySaturn becomes extremely
dangerous. Anyimportant principle tobeunderstood isthatplanets
like theMars andJupiter when debilitated orweak will give negative
results and ifassociated with negative forces ofSaturn andVenus
might behelpful. They rather help Saturn andVenus.
Degrees ofthePlanets
The degrees ofthe different planets areextremely important, assuming
that there arethree planets, Mars, Venus andRahu, which are
conjoined inonehouse. Weneed toknow thedegrees and then
decipher which planet isahead inthe sign. IfMars hasthehighest
degrees followed byVenus andRahu, the results would behighly
different thanRahu having thehighest number ofdegrees followed
byVenus andMars inthesame house. Therefore, itisimportant to
have thedegrees ofalltheplanets ineach sign andthen analyse
the conjunction.
The planets inthezodiacal diagrams whenmove totheother houses
inthemoveable do25% work ofthathouse and70%work ofthe
house inwhich they areposted,
The planets occupying theparticular house being 'Vakri take care
oftheprevious house and cause great progress oftheir occupied
house though with some perplexity.
(3-4-5-6) The planet posted ingood orbadhouses in'Navamsd
givesome effect orNavamsa predictions also inthepredictions
about house where they areposted inRashi Chakra.
The planets having more than 28orlessthan 2atthetime ofbirth
areweak and therefore giveweak effects. The planets having 10-20
arestrong and therefore give strong effects. The planets fading
due toSun atthetime ofbirth areweak planets andhence donot
affect completely.

Conclusion
y^^tthe behest ofPustak Mahal, New Delhi, forwriting abook on
Bhrigu Samhita, Jhave authored thisbook providing alltherelevant
and required information. Ihave dealt with this subject under 4
headings starting from preface togeneral principles onvarious aspects
that are essential regarding thepositions ofvarious planets with
reference toeach ofthe 12signs from Aries toPisces with special
reference tothebirth chart.
Thisbeing aforgotten subject, afewrelevant horoscopes (case studies)

undertaking studies onthis subject.
Hence itisexpected that thisbook willbeused asan initial tool
bythe astrologers who willpursue thismethod also formaking
various kinds ofpredictions. Jpray toGod tobestow long lifeand
